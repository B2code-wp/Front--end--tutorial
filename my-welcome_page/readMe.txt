# Hot Exit

Is a feature the the automatically saves my unsaved work. I then closed / turned it off to prevent VS code from automatically reopening the old repositories

# git rm --cached node_modules
To gitignore to avoid the clutting of our repository which is unnecessary files from, complied code, generated files or dependency files like node module
